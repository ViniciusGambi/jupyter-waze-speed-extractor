> This script extract the speed from waze on a screen record video by an OCR script. It was created to help the validation process of the instrumentation system of our Baja Car. We had needed a reference value of speed to calibrate the instrumentation system which we had created. Then we created it. This Jupyter version was wrote to help people that don't have experiences with the environment setup.
